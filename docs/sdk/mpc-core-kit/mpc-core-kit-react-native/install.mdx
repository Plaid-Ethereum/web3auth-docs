The MPC Core Kit JS SDK contains multiple packages that are needed to enable different
functionalities of the MPC Core Kit JS SDK. You can choose the packages you want to install
according to the functionalities you want to enable in your application. In this doc we have
highlighted all of the packages and their functionalities.

## Base MPC Core Kit React Native Package

This is the base SDK that helps you implement Web3Auth's MPC TSS features while giving you the
flexibility to customize the UI and UX of the authentication process.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @web3auth/react-native-mpc-core-kit
```

## Common Types and Interfaces

This package gives access to common types and interfaces for Web3Auth. This comes in handy by
providing you a standard way of importing the values you need to work with the SDKs. We highly
recommend using it while working with Typescript.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @web3auth/base
```

## EthereumSigningProvider

This package gives EIP1193 compatible Ethereum signing provider. This provider is used to make calls
to the selected blockchain, and can be used with `web3.js`, `ethers.js`, or `viem` to make
integration with Ethereum-compatible chains more easier.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @web3auth/ethereum-mpc-provider
```

## Additional Configuration for React Native

### Add a Custom Transformer

Add a custom transformer to your project by creating a new file called `customTransformer.js` and
updating your metro config to use it. This transformer is specifically designed to handle the
polyfills and transformations needed by the MPC Core Kit SDK.

```js title="customTransformer.js"
const { nodeModulesPolyfillPlugin } = require("esbuild-plugins-node-modules-polyfill");
const reactNativeReactBridgeTransformer = require("react-native-react-bridge/lib/plugin");
const esbuildOptions = {
  plugins: [
    nodeModulesPolyfillPlugin({
      globals: {
        Buffer: true,
        crypto: true,
      },
    }),
  ],
};
module.exports.transform = function ({ src, filename, options }) {
  const transform = reactNativeReactBridgeTransformer.createTransformer(esbuildOptions);
  return transform({ src, filename, options });
};
```

```js title="metro.config.js"
const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

// focus-start
config.transformer.babelTransformerPath = require.resolve("./customTransformer.js");
// focus-end

config.resolver.extraNodeModules = {
  ...config.resolver.extraNodeModules,

  assert: require.resolve("empty-module"), // assert can be polyfilled here if needed
  http: require.resolve("empty-module"), // stream-http can be polyfilled here if needed
  https: require.resolve("empty-module"), // https-browserify can be polyfilled here if needed
  os: require.resolve("empty-module"), // os-browserify can be polyfilled here if needed
  url: require.resolve("empty-module"), // url can be polyfilled here if needed
  zlib: require.resolve("empty-module"), // browserify-zlib can be polyfilled here if needed
  path: require.resolve("empty-module"),
  crypto: require.resolve("empty-module"),
  buffer: require.resolve("@craftzdog/react-native-buffer"),
};

module.exports = config;
```

### Add Buffer in your globals/ entry level file

No need for `react-native-quick-crypto` any longer, just polyfill buffer in your entry file.

```js title="globals.ts"
global.Buffer = require("buffer").Buffer;
```

## Troubleshooting

You might face issues mentioning that certain dependencies are missing within the browser
environment. These are node dependencies that need to be polyfilled in your application, to enable
Web3Auth functionalities. Furthermore, your bundler needs to be reconfigured to use them while
building the app. We have created guides for different bundlers to help you with this issue:
